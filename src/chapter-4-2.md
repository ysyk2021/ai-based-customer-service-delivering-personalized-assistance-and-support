### Surveys and Reviews

Customer surveys and reviews provide direct feedback on their satisfaction, preferences, and pain points. These can be collected through post-purchase surveys, online review platforms, or feedback forms. Analyzing survey responses and reviews helps organizations understand customer sentiment, identify areas for improvement, and tailor their support accordingly.

Social media platforms offer a wealth of customer interactions, including mentions, comments, and direct messages. Monitoring these interactions allows organizations to gain real-time insights into customer opinions, concerns, and feedback. It enables proactive engagement, timely response, and reputation management.

### Customer Support Interactions

Data from customer support interactions, such as chat logs, call transcripts, or email conversations, provide detailed insights into individual customer queries, issues, and resolutions. Mining this data can uncover common pain points, frequently asked questions, or gaps in existing support resources, guiding improvements in AI-powered assistance.
